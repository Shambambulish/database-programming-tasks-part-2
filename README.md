# Assignment task for Web dev course

Retrieving data from database, testing REST and calling backend from React app


Run `npm install` in both the root folder and ./server to install dependencies. Run `npm run devStart` in ./server to run the NodeJS server on localhost port 3001, turn on Apache & MySQL through XAMPP => run the SQL script in ./server/db.sql in http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/server/sql, then run `npm start` in root folder to launch React app on http://localhost:3000

I also completed the part 3 of the task to implement a POST and DELETE route for adding and removing tasks. I thought it'd be silly not to push it to the same repository.

Test REST requests in client.rest - testing was done using REST Client Extension on Visual Studio Code.
